CoreData Model Editor is a macOS app that allows to graphically visualize (and very soon edit) a CoreData Model file.

The good old CoreData graphical editor that was present in XCode disappeared when XCode 14 was released, only leaving the table based editor. This is a nice editor, but nothing is better than a diagram...

I wrote this app to help me with my CoreData models, and decided it could help others too.

## Included features

* Graphical representation of entities, their attributes and their relationships.
* The graphical representation updates (almost) real time when the file is edited in XCode.
* Search the model for a string; all entities, attributes, relationships which name includes this string are revealed.
* Quickly see which entities are part of a configuration thanks to colours.


## Features to come

* Well, the editing part :-) As per today, the app is only a visualization, and edits have to be done in XCode (or any other editor). But what you **can** do is have XCode on one half of your screen, to use its table editor, and CoreData Model Editor on the other half of the screen, to see the diagram. The diagram will update everytime you save in XCode (âŒ˜S).
* Managing Fetch Requests.
* Show the diff between two model versions.
* Show the type of attributes, and the delete rule at each end of a relationship.
* Show model errors & warnings (e.g; missing type for an attribute)


## Where to get the app

The app must be downloaded from the app store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coredata-model-editor/id6449733666

But wait ! It's not a free app !!!

Yes, that's true. The reason is that I would like to cover the developper annual fee to keep it on the App Store. Also, that keeps me motivated ðŸ˜€.
**But it is very cheap**, and it is a pay-once-get-it-forever app. The price may go up as more features will come to the app, so don't hesitate to buy it right now, you'll get all the future features for free ðŸ˜‡.
