CoreData Model Editor is a macOS app that allows you to graphically edit a CoreData Model file (.xcdatamodeld files).

The good old CoreData graphical editor that was present in XCode disappeared when XCode 14 was released, only leaving the table based editor. This is a nice editor, but nothing is better than a diagram...

I wrote this app to help me with my CoreData models, and decided it could help others too.

## V1.1 is now available and... it is an editor !!!

V1.0 was able to graphically visualise the model. Now, the model can be edited too !

## Included features

* Graphical representation of entities, their attributes and their relationships.
* Edit the model as you wish, any entity, any attribute, relationships, create new model versions etc...
* Search the model for a string; all entity, attribute, and relationship names that include this string are found.
* Quickly see which entities are part of a configuration thanks to colours.


## Features to come

* Better validate input texts. Today, inputs texts are used as-is. It would be better if they were checked. For example, an entity name shall not start with a digit character.
* Managing Fetch Requests.
* Show the diff between two model versions.
* Show the type of attributes, and the delete rule at each end of a relationship.
* Show model errors & warnings (e.g; missing type for an attribute).
* Manage individual .xcdatamodel files (today only .xcdatamodeld files are managed).
* Show model warnings or errors.


## Where to get the app

The app must be downloaded from the app store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coredata-model-editor/id6449733666

But wait ! It's not a free app !!!

Yes, that's true. The reason is that I would like to cover the developer annual fee to keep it on the App Store. Also, that keeps me motivated ðŸ˜€.
**But it is very cheap**, and it is a pay-once-get-it-forever app. The price may go up as more features will come to the app, so don't hesitate to buy it right now, you'll get all the future features for free ðŸ˜‡.
